            I can show you the world
            Shining, shimmering, splendid
            Tell me, princess
            Now, when did you last let your heart decide?
            I can open your eyes
            Take you wonder by wonder
            Over, sideways and under
            On a magic carpet ride
            
            A whole new world
            A new fantastic point of view
            No one to tell us, "No"
            Or where to go
            Or say we're only dreaming
            
            A whole new world
            A dazzling place I never knew
            But when I'm way up here
            It's crystal clear
            That now I'm in a whole new world with you
            (Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
            
            Unbelievable sights
            Indescribable feeling
            Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
            Through an endless diamond sky
            
            A whole new world
            (Don't you dare close your eyes)
            A hundred thousand things to see
            (Hold your breath, it gets better)
            I'm like a shooting star
            I've come so far
            I can't go back to where I used to be
            
            A whole new world
            (Every turn, a surprise)
            With new horizons to pursue
            (Every moment, red-letter)
            I'll chase them anywhere
            There's time to spare
            Let me share this whole new world with you
            
            A whole new world
            A whole new world
            That's where we'll be
            That's where we'll be
            A thrilling chase
            A wondrous place
            For you and me
